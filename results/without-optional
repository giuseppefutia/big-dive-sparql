Nikkatsu was very afraid of Kimura and me working together because they thought we might just do something really weird. Kimura makes every movie as if it were his last.

I&#39;d always been a big film freak, into cool camera movement, special effects and different styles of storytelling, different genres, so I very sadly came to the realization that I couldn&#39;t do a normal sitcom for the rest of my life where your characters simply congregate around an office desk or living room sofa.

    <td><pre>"&quot;[Azaria&#39;s] appeal can best be summed up by, of all things, his hilarious cameo in the goofy comedy Dodgeball. As Patches O&#39;Houlihan, the dodgeball champion who will age into the magnificently gruff Rip Torn, he delivers a pitch-perfect performance in an instructional video in which he chain-smokes, encourages a child to pick on those weaker than him, and steals the film from a cast of comedic greats. It&#39;s a wonderful, odd moment that could have failed miserably in the hands of a lesser actor, and he manages to pull it off with only seconds of dialogue. In my humble opinion, and using my limited knowledge of boxing terms: Pound for pound, Hank Azaria is the best actor working today.&quot;"@en</pre></td>

The three days before a fight feel like they&#39;re an hour or two long for me. I love the rules meetings and press conferences and hanging out in the hotel lobby with the fighters. But on the night of a fight, once we get to the locker room, everything moves very slowly. I feel very tense in a way that nothing else, including my own wrestling matches and gym fights, ever made me feel. I&#39;m aware that Lamon&#39;s career is on the line and he&#39;s risking his life every time he steps into the ring.&quot;"@en</pre></td>

    <td><pre>"&quot;Lou Reed doesn&#39;t just write about squalid characters, he allows them to leer and breathe in their own voices, and he colors familiar landscapes through their own eyes. In the process, Reed has created a body of music that comes as close to disclosing the parameters of human loss and recovery as we&#39;re likely to find. That qualifies him, in my opinion, as one of the few real heroes rock &amp; roll has raised.&quot;"@en</pre></td>

The message is that urban life is tough stuff—it will kill you; Reed, the poet of destruction, knows it but never looks away and somehow finds holiness as well as perversity in both his sinners and his quest. . . .

    <td><pre>"&quot;I was surprised by how people reacted to &#39;Like a Virgin&#39; because when I did that song, to me, I was singing about how something made me feel a certain way—brand-new and fresh—and everyone interpreted it as &#39;I don&#39;t want to be a virgin anymore. Fuck my brains out!&#39; That&#39;s not what I sang at all. &#39;Like a Virgin&#39; was always absolutely ambiguous.&quot;"@en</pre></td>

    <td><pre>"&quot;That wasn&#39;t easy. It&#39;s hard to sit in your boxers and jerk off in front of people for three hours. I was pretty heavy, and I was afraid that people would laugh at me. Todd said they might laugh, but they won&#39;t laugh at you. He saw what we were working for, which was the pathos of the moment. Sometimes, acting is a really private thing that you do for the world.&quot;"@en</pre></td>

    <td><pre>"&quot;No modern actor was better at making you feel sympathy for fucking idiots, failures, degenerates, sad sacks and hangdogs dealt a bum hand by life, even as – no, especially when – he played them with all of their worst qualities front and center. But Philip Seymour Hoffman had a range that seemed all-encompassing, and he could breathe life into any role he took on: a famous author, a globetrotting party-boy aristocrat, a German counterintelligence agent, a charismatic cult leader, a genius who planned games of death in dystopic futures. He added heft to low-budget art films, and nuance and unpredictability to blockbuster franchises. He was a transformative performer who worked from the inside out, blessed with an emotional transparency that could be overwhelming, invigorating, compelling, devastating.&quot;"@en</pre></td>

    <td><pre>"&quot;There&#39;s a part that I like, no doubt, because if not, I wouldn&#39;t be involved in acting. What happens is that the popularity that comes to you is not always what you expect: you wanna be greeted when you feel like it. But I never suffered that, because I&#39;ve never exceed the line of massive popularity. It is difficult to learn that the more love, the more shade. That is, there is no ideal popularity, we must assume it, in the same way that many people will love you, many people will reject you.&quot;"@en</pre></td>
